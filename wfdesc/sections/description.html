<h2>3. Wfdesc Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
<p>Scientific workflows are used to describe series of structured activities and computations that arise in scientific problem-solving, providing scientists from virtually any discipline with a means to specify and enact their experiments. From a computational perspective, such experiments (workflows) can be defined as directed acyclic graphs where the nodes correspond to analysis operations, which can be supplied locally or by third party web services, and where the edges specify the flow of data between those operations.</p>



<p>Besides being useful to describe and execute computations, workflows also allow encoding of scientific methods and know-how. Hence they are valuable objects from a scholarly point of view, for several reasons: (i) to allow assessment of the reproducability of results; (ii) to be reused by the same or by a different scientist; (iii) to be repurposed for other goals than those for which it was originally built; (iv) to validate the method that led to a new scientific insight; (v) to serve as live-tutorials, exposing how to take advantage of existing data infrastructure, etc. This follows a trend that can be observed in disciplines such as Biology and Astronomy, with other types of objects, such as databases, increasingly becoming part of the research outcomes of an individual or a group, and hence also being shared, cited, reused, versioned, etc. </p>

<p>Challenges for the preservation of scientific workflows in data intensive science, include: (a) the consideration of complex digital objects that comprise both their static and dynamic aspects, including workflow models, the provenance of their executions, and interconnections between workflows and related resources, (b) the provision of access, manipulation, sharing, reuse and evolution functions to these complex digital objects, (c) integral lifecycle management functions for workflows and their associated materials.</p>

<p>Thus the use of workflow specifications on their own does not guarantee to support reusability, shareability, reproducibility, or better understanding of scientific methods. Workflow environment tools evolve across the years, or they may even disappear. The services and tools used by the workflow may change or evolve too. Finally, the data used by the workflow may be updated or no longer available. To overcome these issues, additional information may be needed. This includes annotations to describe the operations performed by the workflow; annotations to provide details like authors, versions, citations, etc.; links to other resources, such as the provenance of the results obtained by executing the workflow, datasets used as input, etc.. Such additional annotations enable a comprehensive view of the experiment, and encourage inspection of the different elements of that experiment, providing the scientist with a picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the digital experiment in relation to decay, adaptability, stability, etc.</p>

<p>Workflow descriptions can be made using the <a href="https://github.com/wf4ever/ro/blob/master/wfdesc.owl"><tt>wfdesc</tt> ontology</a> under the namespace <a href="http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc#">http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc#</a></p>

<p>The <tt>wfdesc</tt> ontology describes an abstract workflow description structure, which on the top level is defined as a <tt>wfdesc:Workflow</tt>.</p>

<p>A <tt>wfdesc:Workflow</tt> contains several <tt>wfdesc:Process</tt> instances, associated  using the <tt>wfdesc:hasSubProcess</tt> property. Each of these (and the workflow  itself) <tt>wfdesc:hasInput</tt> and <tt>wfdesc:hasOutput</tt> some <tt>wfdesc:Parameter</tt> (<tt>wfdesc:Input</tt> or <tt>wfdesc:Output</tt>). An <tt>wfdesc:Artifact</tt> is associated with a <tt>wfdesc:Parameter</tt> using <tt>wfdesc:hasArtifact</tt>. The <tt>wfdesc:Workflow</tt> also <tt>wfdesc:hasDataLink</tt> several <tt>wfdesc:DataLink</tt> instances, which forms the  connection between parameters.  Thus this ontology allows the description a direct acyclic graph, or a  dataflow.</p>

<p>This ontology is meant as an upper ontology for more specific workflow  definitions, and as a way to express abstract workflows, which could either be hand-crafted by users ("ideal workflow description") or extracted from workflow definitions of existing workflow systems, like Taverna's <tt>.t2flow</tt> and Scufl2 formats.</p>

<p>The <tt>wfprov</tt> ontology shows how to link these workflow descriptions to a provenance trace of a workflow execution.</p>
