        This specification defines a file format for storage and 
        distribution of Research Objects as a ZIP archive; called a
        <strong>Research Object Bundle</strong> (RO Bundle). RO Bundles
        allow capturing a Research Object to a single file or
        byte-stream by including its manifest, annotations and some or
        all of its aggregated resources for the purposes of exporting,
        archiving, publishing and transferring research objects. </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="http://purl.org/wf4ever/model">Wf4Ever Research
            Object model</a> [[!RO]]
            defines a model for aggregating the resources that contribute to a
            scientific work, including domain-specific annotations and
            provenance traces. The unit that collects these resources is called
            a <em>Research Object</em> (<abbr title="Research Object">RO</abbr>)
            and is described in an RDF-based manifest
            according to the <abbr title="Workflow forever">Wf4Ever</abbr> OWL
            ontologies.  The RO model has been formed in particular for the purpose of
            preservation of scientific workflows, but is applicable also in a
            general sense for capturing resources that are related to 
            and together form a whole.
            The <a href="">Research Object primer</a>[[ROPrimer]] provides
            further details and examples of using the RO model.
        </p>
        <p>
        The <a href="http://purl.org/wf4ever/model">specification for the RO
        model</a> does not mandate any particular form for the representation
        of Research Objects.  The Wf4Ever [[ROSRS]] API defines how research objects
        can be accessed and maintained on the web through a RESTful web
        service. Practical use of the RO model has however shown that
        it is also benefitial to represent a research object as a single
        ZIP archive or as file system folders for the purposes of
        downloading and editing a research object. 
        </p>
        For instance a scientific workflow system can export a workflow
        run by saving the workflow, runtime provenance trace and
        generated results to a set of files. A research object that
        represents the workflow run can aggregate and relate these
        resources. However, at the time of running the workflow (e.g. on a
        desktop computer it is not known where or if the user would
        choose to publish the RO; thus the direct use of a ROSRS service
        or minting public URIs is problematic in this situation.
        </p>
        <p>
        A <strong>Research Object Bundle</strong>, as specified by this
document, provides a way to collect the resources that are aggregated in a
research object, represented as files in a ZIP archive, in addition to their
metadata and annotations. The ZIP archive thus becomes a single representation
of a research object and which can be exported, archived, published and
transferred like a regular file or resource.
