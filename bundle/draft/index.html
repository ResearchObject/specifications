        This specification defines a file format for storage and
        distribution of Research Objects as a ZIP archive; called a
        <strong>Research Object Bundle</strong> (RO Bundle). RO Bundles
        allow capturing a Research Object to a single file or
        byte-stream by including its manifest, annotations and some or
        all of its aggregated resources for the purposes of exporting,
        archiving, publishing and transferring research objects. </p>

    This document is an Editors' Draft published by
    <a href="http://www.researchobject.org/">researchobject.org</a>.

    This document is currently work in progress and should not be used as a
    basis for implementations. Questions, feedback and comments are
    kindly requested, either as <a href="https://github.com/ResearchObject/specifications/issues">GitHub issues</a>, or as <a href="https://github.com/ResearchObject/specifications/pulls">pull requests</a> of the

    This document uses the terms [[!URI]] and [[!IRI]] interchangably. As long as
    the implementing technology supports it, all uses of URIs can be interchanged
    with IRIs (e.g. URIs containing unescaped Unicode characters).

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="http://purl.org/wf4ever/model">Wf4Ever Research
            Object model</a> [[!RO]]
            defines a model for aggregating the resources that contribute to a
            scientific work, including domain-specific annotations and
            provenance traces. The unit that collects these resources is called
            a <em>Research Object</em> (<abbr title="Research Object">RO</abbr>)
            and is described in an RDF-based manifest
            according to the Research Object OWL
            ontologies.  The RO model has been formed in particular for
            the purpose of preservation of scientific workflows, but is
            applicable also in a
            general sense for capturing digital resources that are related to
            eachother, and which together form a trackable whole.
            The <a href="https://w3id.org/ro/primer/">Research Object primer</a> [[ROPrimer]] provides
            further details and examples of using the RO model.
        </p>
        <p>
        The <a href="http://purl.org/wf4ever/model">specification for the RO
        model</a> does not mandate any particular form for the representation
        of Research Objects.  The Wf4Ever <a
        href='http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/RO+API+6'>RO
        API</a> [[ROAPI]] defines how
        research objects
        can be accessed and maintained on the web through a RESTful web
        service exposing RDF/XML and Turtle representations. Practical
        use of the RO model has however shown that it is also benefitial
        to represent a research object as a single
        ZIP archive or as file system folders for the purposes of
        downloading, editing and archiving a research object.
        </p><p>
        For instance a scientific workflow system can export a workflow
        run by saving the workflow definition, runtime provenance trace and
        generated results to a set of files. A research object that
        represents the workflow run can aggregate and relate these
        resources. However, at the time of running the workflow (e.g. on a
        desktop computer) it is often not known where or if the user would
        choose to publish the RO; thus the direct use of a web service
        or minting public URIs is problematic in this situation.
        </p><p>
        A <strong>Research Object Bundle</strong>, as specified by this
document, provides a way to collect the resources that are aggregated in a
research object, represented as files in a ZIP archive, in addition to their
metadata and annotations. The ZIP archive thus becomes a single representation
of a research object and which can be exported, archived, published and
transferred like a regular file or resource.

        <h2>Container</h2>
        <p>
        A Research Object Bundle is a structured [[!ZIP]] archive, specializing
        the <a href="https://learn.adobe.com/wiki/display/PDFNAV/UCF+overview">Adobe Universal Container Format</a> [[!UCF]]. UCF is
        based on the EPUB [[OCF]] format, but generalized to be any kind of
        container. The following section gives an informal introduction to the
        UCF format. For the complete, normative details, see the [[!UCF]] specification.
        </p>
        <section id="ucf" class="informative">
            <h3>Universal Container Format (UCF)</h3>
            <p>
            A UCF container is based on the ZIP compression file format [[ZIP]], enforcing <a href='https://learn.adobe.com/wiki/display/PDFNAV/Zip+container'>additional restrictions</a>. The most important restrictions are:
            <ul>
                <li>Reserved filenames in the root directory:
                    <code>mimetype</code> and <code>META-INF</code></li>
                <li>Filenames must be encoded in UTF-8</li>
                <li>Compression must be Uncompressed or Flate</li>
                <li>MAY use Zip64 extensions, but SHOULD only do so when required</li>
                <li>The first file MUST be the uncompressed <code>mimetype</code> and without any extra attributes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>UCF says about <code>mimetype</code>:
            </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://learn.adobe.com/wiki/display/PDFNAV/Zip+container">
            The first file in the Zip container MUST be a file with the ASCII
            name of <code>mimetype</code>, which holds the MIME type for the Zip
            container (<del>application/epub+zip</del> as an ASCII string; no
            padding, white-space, or case change).
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            The actual media type to include in <code>mimetype</code> depends
            on the specific container type (the above quote uses ePub as
            an example).
            See <a href='#ro-bundle-container' class="sectionRef"></a>.

            <div class="practice">
                <p><span class="practicelab" id="mimetype-zip">Use zip -0 -X</span></p>
                <p class="practicedesc">
                To add the <code>mimetype</code> file correctly on a UNIX/Linux
installation with <a href='http://www.infonn-zip.org/'>InfoZip</a>, use
<code>echo -n</code> and <code>zip -0 -X</code>. Below is an example which adds
<code>mimetype</code> correctly as the first, uncompressed file, then the remaining files (excluding <code>mimetype</code>) with the default compression: </p>

            A <em>root file</em> is the entry-point for a UCF container,

        <h3>RO bundle container</h3>
        The RO Bundle container is a specialization of a [[!UCF]] container, with
        the following additions:
        <ul>
            <li>Additional reserved filename in the root directory:
            <code>.ro</code> MUST be present and MUST be a
            directory.</li>
            <li>The <code>mimetype</code> SHOULD be
              <code>application/vnd.wf4ever.robundle+zip</code> (see
              below)</li>
            <li>The <code>META-INF/container.xml</code>, if present,
                SHOULD contain a rootfile entry equivalent to:<br />
                <code>&lt;rootfile full-path=".ro/manifest.json"
                media-type="application/ld+json" /&gt;</code><br />
                If the
                container file is missing, the above rootfile entry SHOULD be
                assumed.  </li>
            <li>The file <code>.ro/manifest.json</code> MUST be
            present, and MUST describe the RO according to <a
            href='#manifest' class="sectionRef"></a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Applications who specialize RO Bundles MAY specify a different
            <code>mimetype</code>, for instance because the
            bundle is used to distribute application-specific data. It is
            RECOMMENDED for such extensions that their media type end
            with <a
            href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6839#section-3.6">+zip</a>
            according to [[RFC6839]] unless it is not considered
            meaningful for a user to treat such bundles
            as a general ZIP archive.
        </p>
        <section id="media-types">
        <h4>Resource media type</h4>
        <p>
          If an application requires a media-type for a resource, for
          instance because it is exposing the RO bundle over HTTP,
          it SHOULD resolve the media type of the resource according to
          this section.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order of preference:
        <ol>
        <li>
          A resource which is a <a href="#rootfile">root file</a> is
          assumed to have the media type given by the
          <code>mimetype</code> of the corresponding
          (or implied)
          <code>&lt;rootfile&gt;</code> entry.
        </li>
          <li>
          If a resource is an external reference (e.g. referenced
          with an absolute <code>http://</code> URI), then its media
          type is given by the HTTP <code>Content-Type</code>,
          which may involve <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html">content
          negotiation</a>.
          </li>
          <li>If the resource is a aggregated in the
          <a href="#manifest">manifest</a>, applications SHOULD use
          the <code>mediatype</code> (<code>dc:format</code>
          in RDF manifests), if present.
          </li>
          <li>
          Failing the above, the media type of a resource MAY be resolved according to the following table
          by case-insensitive matching of its extension (suffix):
          <table>
            <tr><th>Extension</th> <th>Media type</th></tr>
            <tr>
               <td><code>.txt</code></td>

        <h3>JSON-LD and mapping to RO model</h3>
        <p>
        Manifests following the JSON structure defined in
        <a href='#manifest-json' class="sectionRef"></a> with a
        <code>"@context": [
        "https://w3id.org/bundle/context"
    ]</code>
    is intended to be valid [[JSON-LD]] without any additional
    modifications.  Mapping <code>.ro/manifest.json</code> to the
    ORE and [[RO]] models in RDF SHOULD be performed according to the
    algorithm for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-json-ld-api-20140116/#deserialize-json-ld-to-rdf-algorithm">conversion
    from JSON to RDF</a>, as specified in the JSON-LD API [[!JSON-LD]].
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to generate the RDF implied by the manifest, an absolute
    base URI
    SHOULD be assumed according to <a href="#absolute-uris"
    class="sectionRef"></a> with a path element of <code>/.ro/manifest.json</code>.
    This is to ensure that paths starting with
    <code>/</code> don't "climb out" of the
    bundle root, and so that relative paths
    like <code>annotations/soup-properties.ttl</code> are resolved correctly
    within the <code>/.ro/</code> directory.
    For example, generating a random UUID for the RO bundle
    and assuming a base URI of
    <code>app://9c13b6c1-d053-4889-b42d-691b4a54338e/.ro/manifest.json</code>
    then the bundled resource <code>/folder/soup.jpeg</code> will be
    represented in the RDF graph as
    <code>app://9c13b6c1-d053-4889-b42d-691b4a54338e/folder/soup.jpeg</code>.

    <h4>Custom JSON-LD</h4>
    <p>
    Applications who support JSON-LD (rather than just JSON)
    MAY choose to parse and generate statements
    in <code>.ro/manifest.json</code>
    according to the [[!JSON-LD]] specifications.
    </p>
    <p>
    Applications generating JSON-LD MAY provide additional items in the
    <code>@context</code> list, but SHOULD include
    <code>https://w3id.org/bundle/context</code>
    as the last item, to indicate to JSON parsers that
    the manifest can be parsed as plain JSON according to
    <a href='#manifest-json' class="sectionRef"></a>.
    Applications SHOULD NOT use <code>@context</code> at deeper nesting
    levels.
    </p>
    <p>
    Applications MAY add other properties directly
    to JSON Objects defined from
    <a href='#manifest-json' class="sectionRef"></a>,
    but MUST ensure they are valid JSON-LD.
    Note that
    the RO Bundle JSON-LD context does not specify
    the typing of properties outside this specification.

    As an example, to provide additional [[FOAF]] properties
    for the creator of a file:
  </p>
  <pre class="example">
{
    "@context":  [
        "https://w3id.org/bundle/context"
    ],
    "id": "/",
    "manifest": "manifest.json",
    "aggregates": [
       { "uri":      "/README.txt",
         "createdBy": {
             "uri":     "http://example.com/foaf#bob",
             "name":    "Bob Builder",
             <strong>
             "foaf:homepage": {
                 "@id": "http://example.com/bob"
             },
             "foaf:title": "Dr"
           </strong>
         }
      }
    ]
}
  </pre>

    <p>
    Alternatively, additional statements can be made within a
    top-level <code>@graph</code> node according to
    <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#named-graphs">JSON-LD
        Named Graphs</a>.
    For example:
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
{
    "@context":  [
        "https://w3id.org/bundle/context"
    ],
    "id": "/
    "manifest": "manifest.json",
    "aggregates": [
       { "uri": "http://example.com/blog/2012" },
       { "uri": "http://example.com/blog/2013" }
    ],
    <strong>
    "@graph": [
      { "@id": "http://example.com/blog/2013",
        "dcterms:replaces": "http://example.com/blog/2012" },
      { "@id": "http://example.com/blog/2012",
        "dcterms:isReplacedBy": "http://example.com/blog/2013" }
    ]
  </strong>
}
    </pre>
    <p>
    Note that rather than using the above extension mechanism,
    it is generally RECOMMENDED
    to instead store such additional statements in
    an <a href="annotation-content">annotation content</a>
    for purposes of provenance and separation of concern. Although
    technically valid, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use the member
    <code>@graph</code> to embed semantic annotation bodies
    within <code>annotations</code> nodes, as it would duplicate the
    content of the annotation body in the bundle and may lead to
    inconsistencies.

        <p>In addition to the <code>.ro/manifest.json</code> representation
        specified in <a href="#manifest-json" class="sectionRef"></a>, a
        Research Object Bundle MAY include the ORE manifest in
        alternative representations like RDF/XML
        [[RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR]] and Turtle [[TURTLE]], for instance by
        generating them using the <a

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Alternative manifests SHOULD have a path starting with
            <code>.ro/manifest</code>, for instance
            <code>.ro/manifest.ttl</code> for a Turtle representation.
          </li><li>
            When multiple
            manifests are present, applications SHOULD consider
            <code>.ro/manifest.json</code> as the authorative representation of
            the research object.
          </li><li>
            Alternative manifests SHOULD
            represent (at least) the equivalent RDF graph of
            <code>.ro/manifest.json</code>
            (see <a href="#json-ld" class="sectionRef"></a>)
          </li><li>
            Alternative manifests SHOULD be listed in the
            <code>META-INF/container.xml</code> as
            <code>&lt;rootfile&gt;</code> entries with corresponding
            <code>media-type</code> attributes.
          </li><li>
            Any alternative manifest listed as a <em>rootfile</em> MUST

            <code>.ro/manifest.json</code>
          </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    If an application is modifying a research object bundle which
    contains manifests it can't handle (and thus can't update), the
    application SHOULD remove the <code>rootfile</code> entry for those
    unsupported manifests, and MAY delete those manifests from the
    archive.

        Due to their nature as ZIP files, Research Object Bundles might
        be downloaded, copied, moved and republished. In order to avoid
        ambiguity about RO identity and evolution, each Research Object Bundle
        serialization is considered to represent unique Research Objects.
        Thus any of the prefixes above describing resources within the
        bundle are relative to the root of the ZIP file, and the
        <code>id</code> identifying the Research Object is set to
        <code>"/"</code>, meaning the root represents the RO itself.
        </p>
        <section id="escaping">
          <h3>Escaping URIs</h3>
          <p>All identifieres within the manifest are in JSON expressed
                  as escaped [[IRI]]s.
          If the ZIP file contains a filename with escapable characters, e.g.
          <code>/folder with spaces/Δfilename-∈unicode.txt</code>, then this
          SHOULD in JSON be expressed as an escaped IRI, e.g.
          <code>http://example.com/folder%20with%20spaces/Δfilename-∈unicode</code>,
          but MAY alternatively be expressed as an ASCII-escaped URI, e.g.
          <code>/folder%20with%20spaces/%CE%94filename-%E2%88%88unicode.txt</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
          If the research object references an absolute URI (e.g. aggregating
          or as an annotation body), e.g.
          <code>http://www.example.中國/with%20space%20as%20well.txt</code>,
          then this SHOULD in JSON be expressed as an IRI as-is
          (preserving IRI escapes for special characters),
          or using the [[RFC3492]] punycode DNS name:
          <code>http://xn--fiqs8s.example.com</code>.

          <p>
          The filenames as stored in the ZIP file MUST be a <a href="#ucf">valid UTF-8
          filename</a> and SHOULD NOT be URI escaped, as this causes double
          escaping within the manifest.
          <p>
          <p>
          Note that IRIs that syntactically differ may be identifying the
          same resource if they match after comparing them as
          <a href="#absolute-uris">absolute IRIs</a> within the bundle.

          <h3>Absolute URIs for bundle resources</h3>
          <p>
          Applications which require an absolute URI for identifying a
          resource within a Research Object Bundle may choose to use
          the approach presented in this section in
          combination with resolving against the <a href="#prefix">prefix
          table</a> above.
          </p>
          <p>
          The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/app-uri/">app: URI
              scheme</a> [[APP-URI!]] proposes how a URI can be formed for the
          purposes of accessing resources within a ZIP file as if the
          resources were retrieved from a HTTP server. While this is
          primary intended for sandboxing <a
              href="http://www.w3.org/TR/runtime/">HTML
              applications</a>,
          it is equally applicable to Research Object
          bundles for the purposes of sandboxing and for generating a
          URI independent of the location of the ZIP archive.
          <p>
          The app: URI scheme suggests
          generating a UUID string [[!RFC4122]] for minting the <em>authority</em>,
          forming the <em>base URI</em> for the RO bundle.
          For instance, if:
          <pre>http://example.com/example1.robundle</pre>
          contains the file <code>/folder/helloworld.txt</code>, then
          we generate a new UUID
          <code>8191dee8-0b8e-452d-8d64-7706a140185e</code> and
          refer to the Research Object as <pre>app://8191dee8-0b8e-452d-8d64-7706a140185e/</pre>
          and can refer to its bundled file <code>/folder/helloworld.txt</code> as:
          <pre>app://8191dee8-0b8e-452d-8d64-7706a140185e/folder/helloworld.txt</pre>
          <p>
          The type of authority to generate depends on what is the purpose of the
          absolute URI:
          <ol>
              <li>
                  For security/sandboxing when interpreting RO
                  bundles, the authority should be a <a
                      href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.4">v4
                      UUID
                      from random numbers</a>.  Thus the URI is guaranteed to
                  be unique for each interpretation, and can't (reasonably) be
                  pre-guessed.
                  <br />Applications exposing such URIs might
                  want to record the provenance using the <a
                      href="http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/retrievedFrom">pav:retrievedFrom</a>
                  relation to indicate where the bundle was retrieved
                  from. For instance (in Turtle):
                  <div id="retrievedFromExample">
                  <pre class="example">
@prefix pav: &lt;http://purl.org/pav/&gt; .
@prefix xsd: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt; .
&lt;app://15259726-dcbb-42ff-8fc6-36282c98d4e6/&gt;
  pav:retrievedFrom &lt;http://example.com/example1.robundle&gt; ;
  pav:retrievedOn "2013-05-21T14:24:19Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
                  </pre>
                  </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                  For describing/referencing
              content of an RO bundle accessed at a given URL, the authority should be
              generated as a <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.3">name
                  based UUID</a> using v5 (SHA-1 hashing) concatination of the
                  URL namespace
                  <code>6ba7b811-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8</code> (as
                  UUID bytes) and the ASCII-escaped version of the
                  URL. This approach gives
                  a predictable UUID for a particular URL, even if the
                  content at the URL might later change. <br />
                  Applications using this approach might want to declare the equivalent of
                  a <code>owl:sameAs</code> relation between the accessed
                  URI and the generated <code>app:</code> URI in order
                  to record the original URI. For instance:
                  <pre class="example">
@prefix owl: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt; .
&lt;app://7878e885-327c-5ad4-9868-7338f1f13b3b/&gt; owl:sameAs
      &lt;http://example.com/example1.robundle&gt; .
                  </pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                  For purposes of
                  describing the content of an RO bundle as a bytestream
                  independent of its location (for instance on a USB stick),
                  then the authority should be the hexadecimal <a
                      href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/sha256-384-512.pdf">SHA-256</a>
                  checksum of the ZIP archive (not a UUID). This
                  ensures a predictable URI for the same physical
                  representation, where any change to the bundle
                  generates a new identifier.
                  <br />
                  Applications exposing such URIs might
                  want to record the equivalent provenance of a
                  <a href="http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/retrievedFrom">pav:retrievedFrom</a>
                  relation to indicate where the bundle was retrieved
                  from, including the time of retrieval using the
                  equivalent of <a
                      href="http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/retrievedOn">pav:retrievedOn</a>.
                  (See <a href="#retrievedFromExample">example
                      above</a>).
              </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Example app base URIs:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><code>app://15259726-dcbb-42ff-8fc6-36282c98d4e6/</code>
              <em>UUID v4 using pseduo-random number</em></li>
              <li><code>app://7878e885-327c-5ad4-9868-7338f1f13b3b/</code>
                  <em>UUID v5 of the URL
                      <code>http://example.com/bundle1.robundle</code></em></li>
              <li><code>app://587cff3ae37d58af6886d656623bd91237759a42d8fe1575a9744898c01d97d7/</code>
                  <em>SHA-256 of an empty RO bundle</em></li>
          </ul>
