<h2>3. RO Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
<p>A research object aggregates a number of resources that are used and/or produced in a given scientific investigation. This aggregation supports access to those collected resources &ndash; or at least access to the identification of those resources. The resources aggregated in an RO can be distributed, thus a particular user may be allowed to see the metadata associated with a resource without necessarily having access to its content. For example, dereferencing a URI which is aggregated in a Research Object may require further authentication. A research object allows for annotation of the resources aggregated in it, where by annotation we mean the general notion of decorating a resource with some additional, arbitrary information (@@NOTE: the usage of the word "aggregated" to describe the collecting of resources in the RO rather than "contained"). The aggregation provides a container within which these annotations can be asserted, allowing for the capture of context and provenance concerning those relations and annotations. Such context is needed to support, for example, measures of trust of quality.</p>

<p>The aggregated resources of an RO could include workflow descriptions, workflow runs, artifacts, etc. The figure below illustrates a research object described using a manifest. It also illustrates the specific class of research object named workflow research object, which refers to research objects that contain at least one workflow description.</p>

<p>The research object is described in the <a href="ro.owl"><tt>ro</tt>
ontology</a> under the namespace
<code>http://purl.org/wf4ever/ro#</code></p>

<p>This ontology extends the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/vocabulary">OAI-ORE ontology</a>.</p>
