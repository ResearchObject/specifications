# Example of how the target of the oac:Annotation does not have to be present

# OAC allows you to have annotations who talks about a resource without
# directly mentioning it, in our case this could for instance be if you talk
# about a _workflow output port_ in an annotation which target is the
# _workflow resource._ The port is a *part of* the workflow, but that relation
# might be stated in a different annotation.

	# this RO - even if it's used in other ROs.
	
	# One could alternatively use typing on the proxy:

	#manifest:outputProxy a rel:PrimaryData .

	# we might want to ensure it applies to only
	# one resource in the RO.
