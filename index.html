<section id="abstract"></section><!-- abstract --><section id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Scientific workflows are used to describe series of structured activities and computations that arise in scientific problem-solving, providing scientists from virtually any discipline with a means to specify and enact their experiments. From a computational perspective, such experiments (workflows) can be defined as directed acyclic graphs where the nodes correspond to analysis operations, which can be supplied locally or by third party web services, and where the edges specify the flow of data between those operations.</p>

<p>Besides being useful to describe and execute computations, workflows also allow encoding of scientific methods and know-how. Hence they are valuable objects from a scholarly point of view, for several reasons: (i) to allow assessment of the reproducability of results; (ii) to be reused by the same or by a different scientist; (iii) to be repurposed for other goals than those for which it was originally built; (iv) to validate the method that led to a new scientific insight; (v) to serve as live-tutorials, exposing how to take advantage of existing data infrastructure, etc. This follows a trend that can be observed in disciplines such as Biology and Astronomy, with other types of objects, such as databases, increasingly becoming part of the research outcomes of an individual or a group, and hence also being shared, cited, reused, versioned, etc. </p>

<p>Challenges for the preservation of scientific workflows in data intensive science, include: (a) the consideration of complex digital objects that comprise both their static and dynamic aspects, including workflow models, the provenance of their executions, and interconnections between workflows and related resources, (b) the provision of access, manipulation, sharing, reuse and evolution functions to these complex digital objects, (c) integral lifecycle management functions for workflows and their associated materials.</p>

<p>Thus the use of workflow specifications on their own does not guarantee to support reusability, shareability, reproducibility, or better understanding of scientific methods. Workflow environment tools evolve across the years, or they may even disappear. The services and tools used by the workflow may change or evolve too. Finally, the data used by the workflow may be updated or no longer available. To overcome these issues, additional information may be needed. This includes annotations to describe the operations performed by the workflow; annotations to provide details like authors, versions, citations, etc.; links to other resources, such as the provenance of the results obtained by executing the workflow, datasets used as input, etc.. Such additional annotations enable a comprehensive view of the experiment, and encourage inspection of the different elements of that experiment, providing the scientist with a picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the digital experiment in relation to decay, adaptability, stability, etc.</p>

<p>These richly annotation objects are what we call workflow-centric Research Objects. The notion of Research Object (as discussed in [[BECHHOFER11]]) is a general idea that aims to extend traditional publication mechanisms and take us "beyond the pdf" [[FORCE11]]]. An RO is an aggregation of resources along with annotations on those resources. The aggregation itself may also be annotated, where by annotation, we mean the association of arbitrary additional information with a resource. The Research Object thus collects together relevant resources along with annotations that enable the understanding, reuse etc. of its constituent parts. In a workflow-centric Reearch Object describing an investigation for example, annotations could describe how data sources have been used or how intermediate results were derived. Executable papers [[EXEC]] similarly aim to support validation, exploration and interaction in publication in order to support validation. Hunter [[HUNTER06]] proposes the notion of Scientific Publication Packages (SPP) to describe "the selective encapsulation of raw data, derived products, algorithms, software and textual publications". SPPs are motivated primarily by the need to create archives for the variety of artifacts produced during the course of a scientific investigation; they ideally contain data, methods, software and documents, but also their provenance as well.</p>

<section id="scope"><h3>Scope of Wf4Ever Research Objects</h3>

<p>The focus of Wf4Ever is on workflow preservation (and more specifically workflows supporting scientific investigation). Thus the objects that will be described using the model are inherently workflow-centric. Although the basic infrastructure (aggregation + annotation + domain vocabularies) that the RO model supports is applicable to many situations (for example the executable or enhanced publication of [[FORCE11]]), the specific vocabularies defined within the Wf4Ever RO model are intended to support those Research Objects that have workflows (methods) as their primary content.</p>

<p>The intention is that a Wf4Ever Research Object will aggregate information about a workflow (or collection of workflows) possibly including details of its execution trace, the data items consumed or produced by the workflow, plus provenance information about the lineage of the workflow, data items or the aggregation itself. This intention is that this information will support reproducability of the workflows, reuse of the components and, perhaps most importantly will facilitate subsequent understanding of the investigation that the workflow is intended to support. The support of "full-fat" reproducability in terms of re-execution of a process in order to produce identical results is problematic, particularly when operating in a distributed, web-service based ecosystem.</p>
</section><!-- scope --><section id="scope-doc"><h3>Scope of this document</h3>

<p>This particular document describes the vocabularies that describe Workflow-centric Research Objects within Wf4ever. A complete, functional RO based ecosystem will require a number of different services for creation, storage, manipulation, recommendation, visualisation etc. of Research Objects. These services are not considered here. Nor do we discuss vocabularies or mechanisms that support Research Object evolution.</p>

<p>This document describes the v0.1 release of the ontologies.</p>
</section><!-- scope-doc --><section id="tech-soc"><h3>Technical and Social Objects</h3>

<p>Research Objects play multiple roles. In the first case, they are
<em>technical</em> objects. They provide access to the resources that
are needed to support execution of investigations and record the
provenance traces of those executions. They encapsulate dependencies
between resources and maintain versioning information about the
lineage and evolution of those resources.</p>

<p>At the same time, they are <em>social</em> objects. They
encapsulate reusable protocols and know-how. They record best
practices and support reproducability. They are citable artifacts that
can be referred to and quoted. They record and represent information
about the people involved in investigations -- those who create, use,
extend and curate the objects.
</p>

<p>These roles bring requirements on the representation structure and
vocabularies used to describe Research Objects. This specification
focuses on the <em>technical aspects</em> and describes the core
Wf4Ever Research Object vocabularies that provide container
structures and vocabulary for describing workflow objects. Additional
vocabularies covering evolution, lifecycle, versioning and other
social aspects will be covered elsewhere.</p>

</section><!-- tech-soc --><section id="organisation"><h3>Overall Model Organisation</h3>

<div>Research Object = Aggregation + Annotation + RO Vocabularies</div>

<p>The Wf4Ever Research Object model consists of a suite of ontologies or vocabularies that are used to describe workflow-centric ROs. The key ontologies provided are:</p>

<p><b>ro</b>:<br>
Provides basic structure for the description of aggregated resources and the annotations that are made on those resources.</p>

<p><b>wfdesc</b>:<br>
A vocabulary for the description of workflows. This provides an abstraction that can be mapped to different particular workflow systems.</p>

<p><b>wfprov</b>:<br>
A vocabulary for the description of provenance information. This provides an abstraction that can be mapped to different provenance vocabularies.</p>

<p>The RO Model uses two existing vocabularies to provide aggregation and annotation functionality. Object Reuse and Exchange [[ORE]] is used for specifying aggregation of resources and the Annotation Ontology [[AO]] is used to represent annotations.</p>

<p>Each of these ontologies are described in more detail below.</p>
</section><!-- organisation --></section><!-- introduction --><section id="at-glance"><h2>Research Object Vocabularies</h2>

<section id="ro"><h3>Research object (ro)</h3>

<p>A research object aggregates a number of resources that are used and/or produced in a given scientific investigation. This aggregation supports access to those collected resources &ndash; or at least access to the identification of those resources. The resources aggregated in an RO can be distributed, thus a particular user may be allowed to see the metadata associated with a resource without necessarily having access to its content. For example, dereferencing a URI which is aggregated in a Research Object may require further authentication. A research object allows for annotation of the resources aggregated in it, where by annotation we mean the general notion of decorating a resource with some additional, arbitrary information (@@NOTE: the usage of the word "aggregated" to describe the collecting of resources in the RO rather than "contained"). The aggregation provides a container within which these annotations can be asserted, allowing for the capture of context and provenance concerning those relations and annotations. Such context is needed to support, for example, measures of trust of quality.</p>

<p>The aggregated resources of an RO could include workflow descriptions, workflow runs, artifacts, etc. The figure below illustrates a research object described using a manifest. It also illustrates the specific class of research object named workflow research object, which refers to research objects that contain at least one workflow description.</p>

<p><img src="diagrams/ro.png" imagetext="ro.png|border=1,width=600" width="600" style="border: 1px solid black"></p>

<p>The research object is described in the <a href="ro.owl"><tt>ro</tt>
ontology</a> under the namespace
<code>http://purl.org/wf4ever/ro#</code></p>

<p>This ontology extends the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/vocabulary">OAI-ORE ontology</a>.</p>

<p>An annotation aggregated within an ro:ResearchObject.  </p>
<p>Instances of this class are used to annotated resources aggregated within the aggregating research object, proxies of these resources, or the research object itself. In other words, if :ro is the ro:ResearchObject this annotation has been ore:isAggregatedBy, then the annotation should have at least one ao:annotatesResource which is an ore:AggregatedResource which is ore:isAggregatedBy :ro, or the annotated resource is an ore:Proxy which ore:proxyIn :ro, or the annotated resource is :ro.</p>
<p>It is possible for the annotation to also annotate non-aggregated resources, but as above, at least one of them needs to be part of the RO or the RO itself.</p>
<p>As a subclass of ro:SemanticAnnotation the ao:body must point to an rdfg:Graph which contains the actual annotation. </p>

<p>An ro:Resource is an ore:AggregatedResource which ore:isAggregatedBy an ro:ResearchObject. </p>
<p>This specialisation requires that there exists an ore:Proxy which is ore:proxyFor this resource, and which is ore:proxyIn the same ro:ResearchObject the resource ore:isAggregatedBy. Any annotations on such a proxy will descrive the ro:Resource within that particular ro:ResearchObject, in particular dct:creator and dct:created on the proxy will specify who added the resource to the aggregation at what time.</p>
<p>Note that annotations (ro:AggregatedAnnotation) can be added to both the ro:Resource and the ore:Proxy - depending on if the annotation is seen to be globally true (such as the provenance of how the resource was created) or locally true within the Research Object (such as the the resource playing the role of a wf4ever:Dataset).</p>
<p>Not all resources aggregated by an ro:ResearchObject are ro:Resource instances, in particular ro:AggregatedAnnotations will also be aggregated, but will not be "true" RO resources (and thus don't need their own ore:Proxy).  </p>
<p>Aggregated resources MAY also be organised in (potentially nested) ro:Folders to reflect a file-system like structure. Note that any such resources SHOULD also be aggregated in the "mother" ro:ResearchObject.</p>

<p>An ro:SemanticAnnotation is a specialisation of ao:Annotation which requires that ao:body points to an RDF Graph.</p>
<p>This might be a Named Graph or a resource which can be resolved separately from the URI given by ao:body.</p>
<p>This graph SHOULD mention the resources identified by ao:annotatesResource from this annotation, preferably by using their URIs as subject or object of statements.</p>
<p>Note that this use of ao:body is distinct from ao:hasTopic, which also allows the association of a an RDF Graph with an ao:Annotation, but which also implies that this graph is the "topic" (subproperty of bookmark:hasTopic) of the annotated resource. This class does not require this interpretation, it is merely enough that the annotation body mentions the annotated resource, for instance to give it a dc:title or to relate two annotated resources.  Also note that the next version of the AO ontology (v2) might change this definition of ao:hasTopic, removing the need for this class.</p>

</section><!-- ro --><section id="wfdesc"><h3>Workflow definition (wfdesc)</h3>

<p>Workflow descriptions can be made using the <a href="https://github.com/wf4ever/ro/blob/master/wfdesc.owl"><tt>wfdesc</tt> ontology</a> under the namespace <a href="http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc#">http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc#</a></p>

<p><img src="diagrams/wf.png" imagetext="wf.png|border=1,width=600" width="600" style="border: 1px solid black"></p>

<p>The <tt>wfdesc</tt> ontology describes an abstract workflow description structure, which on the top level is defined as a <tt>wfdesc:Workflow</tt>.</p>

<p>A <tt>wfdesc:Workflow</tt> contains several <tt>wfdesc:Process</tt> instances, associated  using the <tt>wfdesc:hasSubProcess</tt> property. Each of these (and the workflow  itself) <tt>wfdesc:hasInput</tt> and <tt>wfdesc:hasOutput</tt> some <tt>wfdesc:Parameter</tt> (<tt>wfdesc:Input</tt> or <tt>wfdesc:Output</tt>). An <tt>wfdesc:Artifact</tt> is associated with a <tt>wfdesc:Parameter</tt> using <tt>wfdesc:hasArtifact</tt>. The <tt>wfdesc:Workflow</tt> also <tt>wfdesc:hasDataLink</tt> several <tt>wfdesc:DataLink</tt> instances, which forms the  connection between parameters.  Thus this ontology allows the description a direct acyclic graph, or a  dataflow.</p>

<p>This ontology is meant as an upper ontology for more specific workflow  definitions, and as a way to express abstract workflows, which could either be hand-crafted by users ("ideal workflow description") or extracted from workflow definitions of existing workflow systems, like Taverna's <tt>.t2flow</tt> and Scufl2 formats.</p>

<p>The <tt>wfprov</tt> ontology shows how to link these workflow descriptions to a provenance trace of a workflow execution.</p>

<p>wfdesc:Artifact is used to provide information about a class of artifacts. For example, it can be used to specify the datatype of a dataset or the structure of a document.</p>
<p>An wfdesc:Artifact is associated with a wfdesc:Parameter using wfdesc:hasArtifact.</p>
<p>The distinction between a parameter and artifact is that the parameter can be customized to describe the particular role the artifact plays with regards to the process (and can be linked using wfdesc:DataLink) - while the wfdesc:Artifact can describe the syntactic and semantic datatype.</p>

<p>wfdesc:DataLink is used to represent data dependencies between process templates. It means that the artifact generated at an wfdesc:Output (identified using wfdesc:hasSource) will be used by a wfdescInput (identified using wfdesc:hasSink).</p>
<p>The wfdesc:Processes that owns the wfdesc:Parameter instances which are the source and sink of a wfdesc:DataLink must be wfdesc:hasSubProcess of a the same wfdesc:Workflow which wfdesc:hasDataLink the data link, or be be parameters of that same workflow.</p>

<div class="comment">
<p>A wfdesc:Workflow is a directed graph in which the nodes are wfdesc:Process instances and the edges (wfdesc:DataLink instances) represent data dependencies between the constituent process templates.</p>
<p>A wfdesc:Workflow defines associated wfdesc:Process using hasProcessTemplate. A specialisation of this property is hasSubWorkflowTemplate, signifying that the process is a WorkflowTemplate itself, which is further described in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>As a subclass of wfdesc:Process a wfdesc:Workflow can also define wfdesc:hasInput/wfdesc:hasOutput parameters - these would be inputs taken at workflow execution time, and final outputs of the workflow. (Note: Not all dataflow systems have this concept of workflow parameters)</p>
<p>wfdesc:Parameter instances are linked using wfdesc:DataLink instances associated with the wfdesc:Workflow using wfdesc:hasDataLink.</p>
<p>A wfdesc:Parameter defined with wfdesc:hasInput on a wfdesc:Workflow is considered an wfdesc:Input "outside" the workflow template (ie. if it is a subworkflow), but an wfdesc:Output "inside" the workflow template (where it can be connected to a wfdesc:Input of a wfdesc:Process). Thus such parameters can be linked "through" the workflow template without having a "mirrored" port inside.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>##</p>
<p>@prefix wfdesc: &lt;http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc#&gt; .</p>
<p>:outerWorkflow a wfdesc:Workflow ;</p>
<p>  wfdesc:hasSubWorkflow :innerWorkflow ;</p>
<p>  wfdesc:hasSubProcess :procA, :procC .</p>
<p>:procA a wfdesc:Process ;</p>
<p>  wfdesc:hasOutput :param1 .</p>
<p>:procC a wfdesc:Process ;</p>
<p>  wfdesc:hasInput :param2 ;</p>
<p>  wfdesc:hasOutput :param3 .</p>
<p>:innerWorkflow a wfdesc:Workflow ;</p>
<p>  wfdesc:hasInput :param4 ;</p>
<p>  wfdesc:hasOutput :param5 ;</p>
<p>  wfdesc:hasProcess :procB .</p>
<p>:procB a wfdesc:Process ;</p>
<p>  wfdesc:hasInput :param6 ;</p>
<p>  wfdesc:hasOutput :param7 .</p>
<p>:innerWorkflow wfdesc:hasDataLink </p>
<p>   [ wfdesc:hasSource :param4; wfdesc:hasSink :param6 ], </p>
<p>   [ wfdesc:hasSource :param7; wfdesc:hasSink :param5 ] .</p>
<p>:outerWorkflow wfdesc:hasDataLink</p>
<p>  [ wfdesc:hasSource :param1; wfdesc:hasSink :param4 ],</p>
<p>  [ wfdesc:hasSource :param5; wfdesc:hasSink :param2 ] .</p>
<p>##</p>
<p>In this example :param1 is the output of :procA. :param1 is the source in a datalink that goes to the input :param4 of the :innerWorkflow. :param4 is however also the source of an inner datalink, going to input :param6 of the nested :procB.</p>
<p>From this :param4 is both an wfdesc:Input and wfdesc:Output (which is why these two classes are not disjoint)</p>

<p>Provenance of workflow execution is described using the <a href="https://github.com/wf4ever/ro/blob/master/wfprov.owl" class="external-link" rel="nofollow" linktype="raw" wikidestination="https://github.com/wf4ever/ro/blob/master/wfprov.owl" aliasspecified="true">wfprov ontology</a>, under namespace <a href="http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc#">http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfprov#</a>. </p>
<p><img src="diagrams/wfprov.png" imagetext="wfprov.png|border=1,width=600" width="600" style="border: 1px solid black"></p>
<p>The <tt>wfprov</tt> ontology describes the provenance of the workflow results. A <tt>wfprov:WorkflowRun</tt> describes the activity of running a <tt>wfdesc:WorkflowInstance</tt>. It groups the <tt>wfprov:ProcessRuns</tt> of the execution with the relationship <tt>wfprov:wasPartOfWorkflowRun</tt>.</p>

<p>Each <tt>wfprov:ProcessRun</tt> represents a step of the workflow execution. It may have dependencies to different <tt>wfprov:Artifacts</tt>, which are modeled with the relationship <tt>wfprov:usedInput</tt>. Every result generated by one of the <tt>wfprov:ProcessRuns</tt> is linked by the relation <tt>wfprov:wasOutputFrom</tt></p>

<p>Different <tt>wfprov:ProcessRuns</tt> may have been executed by different workflow engines. We can specify which one run each step with the <tt>wfprov:wasEnactedBy</tt> relationship.</p>

<p>Finally, we can link each <tt>wfprov:Artifact</tt>, <tt>wfprov:ProcessRun</tt> and <tt>wfprov:WorkflowRun</tt> to their correspondant <tt>wfdesc</tt> description by the <tt>wfprov:describedByParameter</tt>, <tt>wfprov:describedByProcess</tt> and <tt>wfprov:describedByWorkflow</tt> respectively.</p>

<p>Here we can see that Stian has made a research object at 15:01:10, and at 15:02:10 he added <tt>&lt;a_workflow.t2flow&gt;</tt> to the research object. Note that in this case we do not have informatio about when <tt>&lt;a_workflow.t2flow&gt;</tt> was created or by whom.  The research object also aggregates an annotation <tt>:ann1</tt>. This annotation was created by "t2flow workflow annotation extractor" a few seconds after Stian added <tt>&lt;a_workflow.t2flow&gt;</tt> and is an annotation on the aggregated resource. We are also told that the content of annotation <tt>&lt;.ro/ann1&gt;</tt> was created by Marco more than a year earlier. The original annotation by Marco was found inside the <tt>t2flow</tt> by the extractor.</p>

<p>This example serves to illustrate that annotations can be made on both the entire RO and resources aggregated within it.</p>

<p>Resolving the annotation body gives:</p>

<p>Inside the annotation body, which we have been told was done by Marco, we find an abstract version of the .t2flow workflow (using the <tt>wfdesc</tt> ontology) which has been extracted by the agent. This reveals some workflow annotations done by Marco in 2010; title and description on the workflow, and descriptions for the input and output ports.</p>

Updating of the external data repositories has an impact on the curation of the user dataset, it is essential to know how (in which quantity) and when these databases are updated, so that the propagation of these changes through the existing internal relation among the data can be triggered and registered. 
  </p>The scientific experiment represented by this research object pertains to the multi-wavelength study for a sample of the most isolated galaxies in the local universe. This study characterizes each galaxy of this sample through both the measurement of basic astrophysical properties: 

<ul>
<li>The equatorial coordinates in J2000 epoch</li>
<li>The velocities in km/s (v)</li>
<li>The dust extinction coefficient (ag)</li>
<li>The axis ratio of the isophote 25 mag/arcsec2 (logr25)</li>
<li>The apparent total B magnitude (BT)</li>
<li>The morphological type (t)</li>
</ul>

and the calculation of the more complex properties:
<ul>
<li>The distance in Mega parsecs (D)</li>
<li>The corrected apparent B magnitude (btc)</li>
<li>The optical luminosity in B-band (LB)</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, this research object is focused on the calculation of the intrinsic luminosity in the Johnson B-band, in order to achieve it the measurement or calculation of all those astrophysical properties is needed.</p>
